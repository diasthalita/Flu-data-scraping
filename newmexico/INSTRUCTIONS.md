To get started, download the html files for the pages containing the urls for the reports. Run the newmexicorun.sh script. Once it is finished, open the newmexicoresults.csv file.

Because the reports are not consistent, not all data can be retrieved automatically. Please find below information about the data that needs to be extracted manually:

1. The field "Ending Date" need to be cleaned manually.
2. The field "Season" needs to be completed manually. Seasons start around week 40 and end around week 20 of the following year.
3. Add missing weeks and complete fields with N/A.
4. All the fields that read "could not retrieve" needs to be completed manually.
6. NM reports weekly on the number of lab tests since the start of the season. The weekly counts can be obtained by calculating the difference between the current week and week before (e.g, week2 hospitalization equals the total as of week2 minus the total as of week1).
