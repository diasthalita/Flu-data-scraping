To get started, download the html files for the pages containing the urls for the reports. Run the michinganrun.sh script. Once it is finished, open the michiganresults.csv file.

Because the reports are not consistent, not all data can be retrieved automatically. Please find below information about the data that needs to be extracted manually:

1. The fields "Week" and "Season" need to be completed manually. Seasons start around week 40 and end around week 20 of the following year.
2. Add missing weeks and complete fields with N/A.
3. All the fields that read "could not retrieve" needs to be completed manually.
4. MI reports weekly on hospitalization counts from two different sources. The final hospitalization number is the sum of the two. Starting on season 2015 -2016, one of the counts showed the number of hospitalization since the start of the season. The number per week can be obtained by subtracting the prior week from current week analysed.
